Cybersecurity Commentary, Competitions and Research
	
**Incoming Associate Red Team Consultant / Cal Poly Pomona Senior Student**
	
I represent my university at security competitions as the captain of the CPTC team, and a member of the CCDC Linux team. Cybersecurity is a passion of mine and this blog exists for me to share it with others. 

**My Certifications Are:**

- CompTIA Security+
- CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst+

I moved to the US from Russia, so please send all the best Russian hacker jokes my way.
